# Igel

**Igel** is a Clojure'ish Lisp-dialect that compines the worlds of Hardware-description and problem-oriented programming.

There is a REPL for trying out the language, as well as the ability
to run files.

## Why should I use Igel

Igel is a good choice for programming on heterogeneous systems. It can be used for quantum-computing, qbit simulation, hardware-description and verification or even for eneral purpose.The compiled igel core is pretty small and compact (< 200kb). This benefits the language to embed in other programs.

## Features

* Clean implementation in VHDL
* Small binary ( less than 200kb )
* Great FFI's to C and VHDL
* Big standart-library
* More than 100 macro functions
* Hardware-description using own macros
* A self-hosting compiler driver
* And a lot more...
